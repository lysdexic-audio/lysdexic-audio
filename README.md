### lysdexic-audio üëã

I make sound and interaction design & composition tools. MaxMSP, C++, JS, Python etc.

For the last few years I've been full-time as a Senior C++ Audio Software Engineer at [Aimi.fm](https://www.aimi.fm/) - which takes most of my time. I continue to create and update repos here from time to time, please create issues for bug reports and feature requests.
